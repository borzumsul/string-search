\section{Introduction}
The goal of this assignment is to implement and analyze the performance of
several popular string matching algorithms. The algorithms are:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Na\"{\i}ve
\item Rabin-Karp
\item Knuth-Morris-Pratt 
\item Boyer-Moore
\end{itemize}
In this report, we will describe the results of comparing the efficiency of the algorithms against each other. There are several metrics that are useful for string searching algorithm performance analysis: runtime, number of comparisons, worst and best case performance; each one of those metrics will be used in our analysis.
